### Learning Goals:
[x]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The goals were to gain experience building an app that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We were given a provided comp, and our goal was to write HTML and CSS to match it.

### Wins + Challenges:
[x]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
I managed to complete the MVP and my chosen feature (Login Page). I was able to match the provided comp, and was able to add additional styling. The initial challenge was matching the given comp with HTML and CSS. After research I was able to learn and apply ways to help match the app with the comp. Another challenge I faced was when one of my buttons stopped working after I added a Login Page. I was able to overcome it by taking a thorough look at the HTML and CSS files, and how they were being affected by my JavaScript functions.
